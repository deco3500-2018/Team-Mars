# Team-Mars

## Background 

Our team decided to design a project which helps users to break the communication barriers featured by language and culture difference. Language plays a significant role in communication barriers, especially for face to face communication. The lack of understanding other languages not only leads to the inconvenience for people but also might influence their study and life. Therefore, we plan to design a digital translator called Translify in order to help users to study and understand foreign languages, as well as adapt in a new language environment.

## Instructions For How To Deploy And Use Prototype

1. The best way to test the prototype is that you must be running it on Unity Engine since the exported application may include some bugs.

2. Another easier way to run it is to find our unity prototype (EXE.zip) in our GitHub and Download it. You can find our prototype by [click here](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Team-Mars/blob/master/EXE.zip).

3. Once you download the zip file, unzip it in your computer. The file shold look like this: ![](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Team-Mars/blob/master/appendix/capture.png)

4. Open the Transify.exe file, a XFTest Configuration will jump out after you click on it. You can adjust the Graphics and Input setting based on your perferance. 

5. Once You complete the setting, you can click on Play! button to run the program.

6. While the program is running, it should shold look like this:

7. Since the Vocabulary List function needs to work with a database, you will need to download the supported database file, php files and implement them in your local server to get this function to work. The supported files can be found in here: https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Team-Mars/tree/master/Database

8. Now You can click on different buttons on it to play with differnt functions we build in the program.
